              I loved 'The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark' by Jill Tomlinson, not least because of the fabulously named main character: Plop the barn owl!

              I spent some time at a circus school in Turin where I learnt to walk the tight-wire and a couple of moves on the aerial silks. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™d still be able to do them though, as I havenâ€™t practised since. I can still do a head-stand though - does that count?

              I trained at East 15 Acting School and have been puppeteering for the last 6 years. I have been involved in numerous shows including â€˜Wow! Itâ€™s Night-timeâ€™ (Little Angel Theatre), â€˜Arborâ€™ (Smoking Apples Theatre) and â€˜The Adventures of Bo Peepâ€™ (Knuckle and Joint). I have just finished a 5 month tour of â€˜The Smartest Giant in Townâ€™ (Little Angel Theatre), where we have been lucky enough to receive an Olivier Award nomination for Best Family Show! This is my second time performing in â€˜The Singing Mermaidâ€™ and I am full of joy to be returning to Silversands.

I have had the pleasure of playing Tom the Crocodile from Spot the Dog, Azrael in The Smurfs: Live on Stage and even hung out with The Very Hungry Caterpillar. The Singing Mermaid marked my third Christmas Season at Lakeside Arts, having previously been there with Flat Stanley and Red Riding Hood. Itâ€™s great to be back on tour with this lovely show.</p>

              I have been performing since 2006 and am now also a Mum to two children. I work as a puppeteer, actor and more recently as a writer too, creating my own solo shows Delphine and With Child. Some of the productions Iâ€™ve been in are How to Hide a Lion (Polka Theatre), Red Riding Hood (Norwich Puppet Theatre) and Father Christmas (Lyric Hammersmith/ West Yorkshire Playhouse). I was also in The Magicianâ€™s Daughter (Little Angel in association with the RSC).
